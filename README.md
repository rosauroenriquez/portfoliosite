# Personal Portfolio Website

First, I'd like to thank https://www.youtube.com/@GreatStackDev for guiding me in making this site. Check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YFrGy_mzjY&list=PLe8Jv1EdyFpf18dFerKqCfmPlRLq89f83&index=1&t=302s.

Still learning HTML5, CSS, and Javascript and this has been a great project, it taught me a lot. This is still a work in progress and I will be adding more in the future.
